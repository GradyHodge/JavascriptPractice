# MERN_app-template-withAuth
Boilerplate for full MERN stack apps that require security features.

## Overview
Full stack ready for deployment with built in CRUD functions and components.
Made so the file structure is easy to follow and replicate to keep order as app increases in size.
Comes with basic dependencies so developers can choose to add redux or other depencies on top off it. But allows for devs to have more choce on how app is built. This version comes with jsonwebtoken and bcrypt for hashing and authentication.

**__Site is deployment ready out of the box__**

## How to use it
Clone repo as local file refrence then copy files into your project. Then on server.js level open terminal and type *npm install* this will install backend dependencies and then it auto switches to client side and installs dependencies.

Once dependencies are installed type *npm start* in termial. This will start the server then swithc to client and boot it. It will open up tab in your default browser.

**Be sure to link DB with mlab or other extension**
